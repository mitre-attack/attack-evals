	   	<p>
			The evaluation focuses on articulating how detections occur, rather than assigning scores to vendor capabilities.</p>
		<p>
			For the evaluation, we categorize each detection and capture notes about how those detections occur. We organize detections according to each technique. Techniques may have more than one detection if the capability detects the technique in different ways, and detections we observe are included in the results. While we make every effort to capture different detections, vendor capabilities may be able to detect procedures in ways that we did not capture. For a detection to be included for a given technique, it must apply to that technique specifically (i.e. just because a detection applies to one technique in a Step or Sub-Step does not mean it applies to all techniques of that Step). For proof of detection in each category, MITRE requires that the proof be provided to us, but we may not include all detection details in public results, particularly when those details are sensitive.</p>
		<p>	
			To determine the appropriate category for a detection,we review the screenshot(s) provided, notes taken during the evaluation, results of follow-up questions to the vendor, and vendor feedback on draft results. We also independently test procedures in a separate lab environment and review open-source tool detections and forensic artifacts. This testing informs what is considered to be a detection for each technique.		</p>
		<p>
			After performing detection categorizations, we calibrate the categories across all vendors to look for discrepancies and ensure categories are applied consistently. The decision of what category to apply is ultimately based on human analysis and is therefore subject to discretion and biases inherent in all human analysis, although we do make efforts to hedge against these biases by structuring analysis as described above.</p>
		<p>	
				There are nine possible detection categories. These categories are divided into two types: “Main” and “Modifier.” Each detection receives one “Main” category designation and may optionally receive one or more “Modifier” category designations.</p>	
		<p>
			<strong>We break the two category types down as follows:</strong>

									The vendor is unable to detect red activity due to capability limitations or other reasons. If data is available that is not directly relevant to the procedure tested, this will be categorized as “None.” In these cases, a vendor may receive a categorization of “None” with additional notes and screenshots about that data. 
								</p>
								<strong>Detection constraints:</strong> None is a Main detection type.
								<table class="table table-bordered table-light mt-2">
									<thead>
										<tr> <th scope="col">Examples</th></tr>

									<tbody class='bg-white'>

										<tr><td>An alert fires at the same time that the red team performs the procedure, but it is not related to the technique under test.</td></tr>

									The capability produces some minimally processed data that is accessible to an end user and directly indicates that the red team activity occurred after the user performs human analysis. There is no evidence of complex logic or an advanced rule leading to the data output, and no labeling occurs other than simple field labeling. The detection needs to be demonstrably and logically related to the actual procedure performed. Proof of detection could include the view, query, or API search used to access the data and/or the detection output (e.g., table view or process tree).  
								</p>
								<strong>Detection Constraints:</strong> Telemetry is a Main detection type. The Telemetry category is only applied once per procedure, though there may be multiple ways of using different Telemetry to find the events in question.

									The capability captures data (usually data as described above in the “Telemetry Available” category) and then enriches it with additional information such as a rule name, labels, tags, or ATT&CK tactics or techniques that would assist in a user’s analysis of the data beyond what would have been originally presented. The enrichment must be demonstrably and logically related to the ATT&CK technique under test. There is no evidence of complex logic or an advanced rule leading to the data output beyond a simple “if X, tag with Y” condition. Proof of detection could include the view, query, or API search used to access the data and/or the detection output (e.g., table view or process tree).

									The capability produces an alert detection for suspicious or potentially malicious behavior based on some type of reported complex logic or rule (beyond a simple “if X, display Y Rule Name,” which would be categorized as Enrichment). The alert must be demonstrably and logically related to the  technique under test, and the capability must have a visual designation indicating this is an alert (e.g. an icon indicating an alert, a notification, an impact score, or a similar visual representation). This detection may provide an ATT&CK “tactic”-level description (e.g. Discovery, Execution, etc.) and/or a general description indicating the behavior is anomalous but does not provide specific details on the procedure detected (i.e. a “black box”). (An ATT&CK reference is not necessary for detection to be categorized in this way, though would be noted if included.) Proof of detection could include the rule name or module that performs the detection as well as detection output.

The detection includes additional language and/or explanation to provide more detail beyond a general designation that the behavior is malicious.

											The capability does not detect the activity in real-time or near-real-time when the red team executes the action, but subsequent alerts, data, enrichment, or additional processing produce a detection for the activity. The Delayed category is not applied to data based solely on the time it takes for regular detections to appear in the capability, nor is it applied due to range or connectivity issues that are unrelated to the capability itself. Proof of detection must include explanation for the delayed detection and proof that could include other alerts, narrative, queries used to obtain the detection, and/or the detection output.

											The capability detects the activity based on previously identified suspicious/malicious behavior that is related to or “tainted by” the detection.
